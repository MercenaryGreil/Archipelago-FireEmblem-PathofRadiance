# Archipelago-FireEmblem-PathofRadiance

Manual APworld for use with the Archipelago randomizer.

This manual is a work in progress and in need of testers.

I believe the logic has improved from the Alpha but I have not tested it yet.

It still lacks programmed Starting Items so I'll look into that for the next update.

Within logical reason you can use starting weapons (Ranks E-D). You can also feel free to use the required vulnerary use in the prologue chapter.

Other than that, for the most part, you're meant to wait for other players to send you items, weapons ranks, skills, equipment, units, and class promotions before being able to use them in a playthrough.



There are 4 different built-in "Victory" points or "Goals"



GOAL OPTIONS:



&nbsp;   Completing Ch. 8

&nbsp;   Ike's promotion to Lord at the end of Ch. 17

&nbsp;   Completing Ch. 27 (defeating the Black Knight)

&nbsp;   Completing Endgame (Defeating Ashnard)



So those victory points will trigger your goal and whatever else you have programmed for your AP. So you can manually select one of those depending on how long you want the playthrough to be.



PS: It is recommended to play a new game on a save file that has already finished a play-through. (You don't have to but it will make the Band's you receive via AP items useless) -Note that you will not have checks in your play-through tied to getting the bands as I did not program those as checks.



Some save game data if you want to pick one that has save data with a cleared playthrough to be able to get the bands in your run:

CHECKS:

Completing a story chapter give you a check.

Any units that join you rewards you with a check per unit.

Every character has a check for their available class change.

Every chest and visitable house has been organized by chapter as individual checks.

Every Item dropped by a boss or an enemy on a "Rout" victory condition chapter will give a check.



For clarity, when you use the manual:

Any weapon that is not listed as a receivable item is considered unlocked from the start of the game. You will just need to get the weapon rank "item" from other players in the AP that is required to use the weapon you wish to use. (some late game or unique weapons require receiving them as "items" from other players in order to use them,



I'll need further testing to see how well this works in a playthrough.



Clarification on the "Choose X character" items: This really only applies to Chapter 8 and onwards. The lack of these items in your playthrough does not impact chapters 1-7 because you don't have the option of choosing your units before you start the map. Starting chapter 8+ you will have to have those specific items to allow you to choose more units besides Ike.



Optionally you can also use Lush’s FE Universal Randomizer, “Yune”.

Any suggestions/changes/feedback/volunteers to test would be greatly appreciated!
